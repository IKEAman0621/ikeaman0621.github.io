        <p>
            Super metroid is a game developed and released by nintendo in 1994. 
            The game follows bounty hunter Samus Aran on a mission to rid the planet Zebes from the space pirate invasion,
            aswell as the sentient supercomputer mother brain. To do this the player is expected to collect items, 
            defeat bosses, and explore the underground caverns of Zebes. 
            Culminating in defeating mother brain and escaping as the planet explodes behind you.
            Because of severall oversights during development however, the game is able to be played however the player wants,
            with the only limiting factor being player skill.
            This allows for an experience with the game that is neverendingly complex and infinitely improvable.
            Because of this freedom the game has garnered a large speedrunning community, 
            being the 19th most ran game on speedrun.com
