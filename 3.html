                <p>
                    Furthermore all beams, have a special effect when paired <i>only</i> with charge beam.
                    The effect occurs when a power bomb is selected and charge is held.
                    This causes beam particles to appear in a certain pattern. 
                </p>

                        This is by far the most useful of the different beam attacks.
                        The attack itself spawns four wave-beam particles that move towards Samus,
                        arching chaotically with every movement.
    
                        The combo has applications within three of the five main bossfights in the run, 
                        and can be used on the one miniboss in any% aswell.

                    <p>
                        This effect causes four Ice beam particles to circle around Samus. 
                        Since the four particles deal slightly more damage than a power bomb 
                        it's optimal for categories which don't have wavebeam, and need damage.

                        This effect causes two spazer-like shots to circle around Samus, from her head to her feet.
                        Then going back up, to finally rain down again. 
                        The combo has some uses in nieche categories, but isn't widely used.

                <h3>
                    Beams - Glitches
                </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Spazer</li>
                    <li>Plasma Beam</li>
                    <li>Any boot item: (Hi jump boots, speed booster, space jump) </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There is one main glitch with beams, and it involves selecting both Spazer and Plasma, 
                    which are mutually exclusive.
                    To perform this glitch, set spazer as active and move over to your boot item of choice.
                    Then, press left and equip at the exact same time. 
                    Time it early and you'll unequip your boot item,
                    time it late and you'll equip plasma, unequiping spazer in the process.
                    If you do time it correctly both Spazer and Plasma should be equiped,
                    with plasma having a glitched label, with "var" on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From here, a lot of different buggy behaviour can be attained by using different combos.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Murder beam: This is potentially the most useful glitched beam. 
                        It is the combintion of all beam types. To fire the beam, 
                        a shot has to be charged before equiping murder beam.
                        Then once charged and only once it is fully charged, it can be fired, 
                        only staright forward whilst facing left.
                        If it's fired uncharged, or whilst not facing straight left the game will crash.
                        Firing the murder beam places an invisible column of damage, 
                        where the shot was fired, that deals continuous damage every frame.
                        This is useful for IGT (in game time) but not for real time,
                        as the lag it causes slows the game considerably.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Space time beam: This beam combination is achieved by selecting all beams apart from Wave Beam.
                        When this beam is fired, uncharged, it either crashes the game or causes other weird behaviours.
                        If the beam is fired in a sufficiently large room, and the payer quits out of the game,
                        the game will be reset, with all the players items intact.
                        This isn't useful for anything else than messing around with overpowered items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chainsaw beam: This beam combo has all beams except Charge-and/or Ice Beam.
                        The beam has a high fire rate but no range, 
                        and won't deal damage outside of a power bomb explosion.
                        This is the least useful glitched beam, but still maybe fun to mess around with.
