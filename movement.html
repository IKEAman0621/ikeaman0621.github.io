            <h3>Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important aspects of super metroid speedrunning is the movement of Samus Aran. 
                    Her movement is very detailed and nuanced, this, in turn, allows for skips and tricks to be performed.
                    The more general optimisations include armpumping and edgegrabbing, these dont allow for much in terms of
                    skips or tech, but make a run flow better, leading to faster times.
                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Armpumping is the act of repeatedly aiming diagonally upwards and downwards to propell Samus forward faster.
                        To perform an armpump, hold the aim-diagonally-up button and repeatedly mash the aim-diagonally-down button.
                        On every aim diagonally down Samus moves forward one extra pixel whilst running.
                        Do note that this does not work on downward slopes, 
                        as the extra pixel makes Samus airborne, and once she lands she'll lose her speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Edgegrabbing is the act of doing an action to extend Samus' hitbox to land faster. 
                        This could be done in a plethora of different ways, 
                        and it usually depends on what you're doing which way you want to do it.
                        To perform an edgegrab, jump whilst moving to get Samus into a spinjump, where she spins in the air.
                        Then, when you're about to land, instead of just landing  
                        aim up or aim diagonally, as aiming down shifts your hitbox further up, or you could shoot. 
                        This'll extend Samus' hurtbox, making you land a bit faster.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="tech" class="container">
                <h3>Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    There are more important parts of movement for tech. The ones that were probably dev intended are walljumping and shinesparking.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Walljumping is unique for super metroid as unlike games like hollow knight or the mario series,
                        a walljump in super metroid is performed by moving away from a wall, and then tapping the jump button.
                        At first this feels unintuitive, but as it's practiced you'll develop a flow.
                        The way that walljumping is implemented furthermore allows for continuous height gain on a single wall.
                        To perform this walljump it's vital to press back into the wall immediately after pressing jump.
                        An important point to make is that walljumping can only be performed when in a spinning state. 
                    </li>
           
                    <li>
                        Shinesparking can only be performed once the speedboster, located in norfair, has been acquired.
                        When actively speedbosting the duck-input can be pressed which'll make Samus enter a flashing state.
                        To perform a shinespark press the jump button whilst standing still. 
                        This will drain your HP and send you straight upwards.
                        Further, shinesparks can be angled diagonally upwards, to angle your shinespark press the aim-diagonally-up button,
                        then jump, this will send you flying diagonally instead of straight upwards.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="advanced_tech" class="container">
                <h3>Advanced Tech</h3>
                <p>
                    For more advanced players there is more advanced/unintended movement tech. 
                    Among them are: damage boosting, bombjumping, short-charging, mid-air shinesparks, mockballs and gravity jumps.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Damage boosting is the act of taking damage from a source, to then fly in the opposite direction. 
                        To perform a damage boost, move into a damage source, and whilst Samus flashes white, 
                        press jump and the opposite direction Samus is facing. If done correctly Samus will shoot away, 
                        opposite of the way she's facing.
                        Different damage sources have different timings for the white flash.
                        Spikes and similar sources, like electricity, have 10 frames to press jump and a direction.
                        Enemies have only 5 frames, and projectiles have only 4 frames.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Bomb jumping is the act of repeatedly placing bombs below Samus to gain height from the explosion. 
                        A few different ways of bomb jumping exist, however the way covered here is the easiest.
                        Bomb jumps are generally good for slow height gain, as even the fastest ways are really slow.
                        To bombjump place a bomb, and just before it goes off, place the next bomb. 
                        Then you place a bomb as close to the previous bomb as possible, whilst still gaining height.

                        Short charging is a "glitch" that abuses the way speedboster is chraged. 
                        To charge the speedboster the game runs a check at one frame 
                        in her movement animation to see if Samus is running.
                        If she is running she gains one level of charge.
                        Once four is reached she gains the speedbooster state.
                        To short charge you tap the runbutton on these animation frames, 
                        which'll end up with you getting a speedboost with less distance travelled.

                        A mockball is a trick that allows the morphed ball state to travel at sprinting speeds.
                        To perform a mockball there are different methods, using a door, using a roof, or just timing it.
                        
                        To mockball through a door, sprint towards an open door, jump through it and during the door transmission,
                        release the run button and aim downwards, keep holding the jump-button.
                        As you approach the ground press downwards and forwards whilst still holding the jump button.
                        Now you'll move faster in the morphed state.

                        Mockballing of a ceiling is done by getting a runing jump, then once the ceiling is reached,
                        you aim downwards, whilst holding jump, then press down and forward as you touch the ground.
                        This is harder than executing a mockball through a door, but not by much.

                        The timing for performing a mockball "raw" is as follows. Get a running start, jump, 
                        release jump, press jump again, then aim down whilst still holding jump, 
                        then down and forwards as you touch the ground. ¨
                        This isn't much harder, however the window for the mockball can be tighter this way.

                        Mid-air shinesparks are, as their name suggests, shinesparks that are performed in the air.
                        This can be used for severall different purposes, your imagination is really the only limiting factor.
                        To perform a mid-air shinespark, get to the flashing, shine spark state, then perform a regular spinjump.
                        Once the desired height is reached release jump, and break out of spinn by aiming downwards
                        or diagonally-downwards. 
                        Then hold jump and quickly choose a direction, up, or diagonally.
                        If jump is held through the entire jump, 
                        a shinespark upwards or diagonally upwards can be achieved by just aiming.

                        Gravity jumps are perfomed when Samus performs a jump in liquid with the gravity suit, 
                        and in quick succession unequips the gravity suit.
                        This will apply the speed of regular jumping onto the gravity of being in liquid without the gravity suit,
                        making Samus jump really high.
                        To perform a gravity jump, find your liquid body of choice, then press the map-button.
                        During the brief fadeout before the map appears, start running and then jump. 
                        Then navigate to the menu screen and unequip gravity suit.
                        Close the map/equip screen and you will now be flying.
                        Depending on timing of the jump you might get varying results.
