                <h3>Suit upgrades</h3>

                <p>
                    There are two key suit upgrades Samus can acquire, those two being:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Varia Suit</li>
                    <li>Gravity Suit</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Both upgrades independetly allow for Samus to survive super-heated rooms. 
                    And grtavity suit further allows for greater movement in liquids.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the more technical side, both suits further reduce damage taken, Varia by 50% and Gravity by 75%.
                    These stack multiplicatively and not additively, meaning you won't get -25% damage if you get both suits.
                    Furthermore, the Gravity suits damage reduction doesn't work for mother brains rainbow beam, 
                    instead taking 100% of the damage, the Varia suit doesn't feature that limitation however.
                </p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>
                    Beams
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The different beamm upgrades of Super Metroid allow for a plethora of different tech.
                    There's five beam types total:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Charge Beam</li>
                    <li>Ice Beam</li>
                    <li>Spazer</li>
                    <li>Wave Beam</li>
                    <li>Plasma Beam</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These five beams allow for different tricks and skips.
                    They have different properties that are as follows:
                    Charge beam is your standard beam, further allowing for charging, to deal extra damage.
                    Ice beam builds uppon the chargebeam, increasing damage by a little, 
                    and allows for freezing enemies instead of outright killing them.
                    Spazer simply expands the hitbox of the shot, whilst also increasing damage.
                    Wave beam shots go through walls, and increase damage even more.
                    Plasma beam pierces enemies, and allows for damaging certain undamagable enemy types,
                    also increasing damage by a lot.
                </p>

                <h3>Misc. upgrades</h3>

                <p>
                    The miscellaneous upgrades are as follows:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Morphing Ball</li>
                    <li>Spring Ball</li>
                    <li>Bomb</li>
                    <li>Screw Attack</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The moprhing ball is the first item available in the game. 
                    It allows Samus to shrink to one third her original size, 
                    allowing her to fit through smaller gaps.
                    It is also the conduit of tons of tech as the ball form can keep momentum and bounce.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The spring ball simply allows for the morphing ball to perform a jump.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bombs are picked up early in the game, soon after the morphing ball. 
                    They allow for an infinite laying of bombs form the morphing ball.
                    Bombs explode after a short timer and bounce Samus away from the explosions origin,
                    this in turn allows for tech.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The screw attack is one of the last "main items" you'll find in Super Metroid.
                    It gives Samus' spinjump a new lightning effect,
                    and lets her kill most non-boss enemies in the game, 
                    aswell as dodging projectiles.
                </p>

                <h3>Boot upgrades</h3>

                <p>
                    The boot upgrades are as follows:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Speedbooster</li>
                    <li>Hi-jump Boots</li>
                    <li>Spacejump</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Speedboster is one of the most useful upgrades Samus can pick up.
                    After you've picked up the speedbooster, 
                    holding the run button for long enough charges a state of super speed,
                    killing most non-boss enemies, and breaking speedboster blocks.
                    From the speedboster state you can further move into a shinespark.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Hi-jump boots are an upgrade to Samus' jumpheight. There's not much else to it.
                    The increases jump height allow for some extra tricks, whilst making others harder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Spacejump allows Samus to indefinentily jump in the air, 
                    so long as she remains in a spinjumping state. 
                    If she is she can continuously jump if the jump-button is pressed with good timing.
                </p>

                <h3>Selectables</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Missiles</li>
                    <li>Super Missiles</li>
                    <li>Power Bombs</li>

                    <li>Reserve-tank</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The missiles are the bread and butter for your damage output in the early game.
                    Each missile deals 100 damage. Missile packs lie allover Zebes,
                    Giving 5 missiles and granting Samus room for 5 extra total.
                    There is a 10-frame lockout between firing missiles.
                    5 missiles can open red/pink doors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Super missiles are a tool that work alongside your regular missiles to deal damage.
                    They deal 300 damage per shot, and for some bosses that is increased to 600 damage.
                    Super missile packs give 5 supers, and allows Samus to carry 5 extra.
                    The super misiles feature a 19-frame lockout between firing.
                    Because of their fast flight speed, they can cause some glitchy behaviour.
                    1 Super missile can open a green door, aswell as a red/pink door.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Power bombs are mainly used to get rid of blocks and for their beam combos.
                    The same as the others, a pack grants 5 power bombs and rasises max capcity by 5.
                    Power bombs deal 200 damage in a massive area, 
                    breaking any powerbomb or regular bomb blocks in that area.
                    1 Powerbomb can open yellow doors, aswell as blow open the tube into maridia.
