                <p>
                    The different categories of super metroid allow for different bossfights.
                    Some categories will give easier fights, while others give harder fights.
                    In this part I'll try to cover most techniques to fight the most commonly fought bosses.

                <h3>Bomb Torizo</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>HP: 800</li>
                    <li>DMG: 8/10 (POWER SUIT)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The bomb torizo is the first "boss" enemy you'll face in any run.
                    After the bombs have been collected the door to the room turns gray,
                    and you're locked inside.
                    Then a short cutscene plays, and after you fight the bomb torizo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The strategy to fighting the bomb torizo is to shoot it's projectile attacks to gather missiles, 
                    which you'll then use to kill it. Optimaly you take no damage to only allow for missile drops.
                    An entirely optimal fight will also count its shots to perfectly kill the 
                    bomb torizo without it entering its final phase, which skips a cutscene, saving time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is also a way to skip the bomb torizo fight, 
                    using frame perfect shenanigans you can leave the room before the door turns gray.
                    But this isn't allowed for the leaderboard, and is ridiculously hard to perform.

                <p>
                    Sporespawn is the first real boss type enemy, guarding the super missiles needed to progress.
                    This fight is easily skipable with one of the multiple ways of attaining supers early.

                    <li>DMG: 2/10/16/20 (POWER SUIT)</li>

                    </ul></li>

                <p>
                    Kraid is the first of the four main bosses Super Metriod feature.
                    His fight revolves around the player shooting his eyes, 
                    whilst avoiding hitting his claws,
                    at which point he'll open his mouth after a short delay.
                    Then a weapon of choice can be fired into his mouth.
                    He has 1000 hitpoints and once he drops below 860 hitpoints he'll do a lenghty
                    "stand up" animation and start using more difficult patterns.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The kraid quick kill, sometimes shortened to KQK can be performed to skip this cutscene.
                    What it entails is dealing enough damage to kraid in one cycle to kill him, 
                    without giving him the chance to stand up. This is done by "locking" kraids mouth open.
                    To do this you'll have to hit his open mouth on a specific animation frame.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    There are severall ways to perform KQK, the easiest one, in my opinion, 
                    is using two missiles and three supers. Uppon entering the bossroom,
                    line up the left side of Samus' feet, whilst aiming right and diagonally downwards,
                    Then morph into a ball to reduce lag.
                    Once kraid has risen, unmorph and wait for his claw to swing downwards. When it does, 
                    jump and fire two missiles in quick succession, 
                    if the second missile connects you've hit the timing correctly.
                    Then, once you've landed, hesitate for a small time window.
                    Then jump up and fire three supers into kraids mouth.

                    Crocomire is a miniboss that guards the passage to grappling beam.
                    His fight involves hitting him in his mouth with a weapon he's vulnerable to.
                    This will cause him to back up, and once he backs up into a pit of lava the fight is over.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The fight with Crocomire can be skipped by performing any of the moat-skips to access wrecked ship.
                    Thus making the fight unecessary in categories which don't need grappling beam.

                    Phantoon is the second boss of the golden four, intented to be fought.
                    His bosfights revolves around his pattern of spinning around the bossroom, 
                    then briefly opening his eye, at which point, a weapon he is vulnerable to will damage him.
                    During his spinning phase he'll spawn blue flames, which make one jump towards Samus.
                    Phantoon also spawns a ring of these blue flames uppon appearing.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    If Phantoon is not hit during this window he'll dissapear, spawning a few blue flames, 
                    then finally appearing randomly in the room, raining down a line of blue flames.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Once Phantoon is damaged in any way he'll start flying around the room in a chaotic pattern.
                    During this phase once he takes up to 300 damage in one barrage, 
                    or 400 damage total he'll dissapear, resetting to the spinning phase.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The most optimal ways to beat Phantoon depend on category. 
                    In categories which get wave before Phantoon X-factors are commonly used.
                    Otherwise a strategy known as "the doppler effect" is used.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The X-factors can be performed in two different ways. 
                    Either they're timed by unequiping a secondary beam, 
                    or by precisely timing the release of the X-factors.
                    To do the easier method of the two, timing by unequiping a beam,
                    charge a beam shot with spazer and wave. 
                    Then use a pseudoscrew to go through the blue flame ring.
                    Hit Phantoon twice with this beam combo fully charged, 
                    then go to the left side of the room.
                    Time a jump and unequip the beam as Phantoon is approaching.
                    If it is timed correctly all four X-factor particles will connect.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The doppler effect is a way to deal more damage than intended to Phantoon in one cycle.
                    By walking towards Phantoon as you fire missiles he won't dissapear.
                    The timing of the missiles is very strict, this makes the trick quite hard to perform.
