                    Super metroid is a game with a million different tricks, some of which can be used to gain time.
                    Others are needed to make certain routes possible. 
                    These are everything from clipping through walls, skipping bosses, flying through rooms, and so on.
                    The following list is not exhaustive, but rather a collection of tricks I've hit live, 
                    that I'll try and explain. This part of the guide assumes you've read previous parts, 
                    and will reference to those parts by name.

                    Early supers is an important trick in most categories. 
                    The skip involves performing a mockball through the top left door of green brinstar.
                    This will allow Samus to slide under the gates, giving access to early supers.
                    This will, in turn, allow the player to skip the sporespawn fight.

                    Lava spark is a trick in categories which don't collect spacejump. It is used to enter lower norfair.
                    A lavaspark is performed by short-charging in the room before the lava dive room. 
                    After the short-charge through the door a duck-input is pressed to enter a shinespark state.
                    This duck must be close enough to the ledge that Samus falls in as you press duck.
                    After attaining the shinespark state a damageboost is performed, off of a dog flame,
                    and with propper timing, a vertical or diagonal shinespark is performed to reach the door into 
                    the elevator room.

                    Blue suit is the state attained after defeating Draygon with a shinespark.
                    Generally the setup isn't hard, 
                    all that is needed is for Samus to collide with Draygon whilst shinesparking.
                    This will have Samus in a "Blue suit" that has all the propperties of speedbosting Samus, 
                    but'll allow for stopping. Pressing down at any point will award the player with a shinespark state.
                    Do note that if the run-button is pressed regular speedboster will be awarded and blue suit will be lost.

                The Zebetite skip is performed at the end of a run to skip having to destroy the Zebetites, 
                thus not having to collect more than 15 missiles, 
                this skip is also generally faster than destroying the Zebetites.
                To perform the Zebetite skip, stand under the first zebetites platform and wait for a Rinka to spawn.
                Once it does freeze it, then jump up onto the Zebetites platform, right next to the Zebitite.
                If wavebeam was acquired then the Rinka can be frozen from the platform directly.
                Once in the corner wait for the next Rinka to connect with Samus, adjust to land back onto the platform,
                Spinjump back into the corner and finally spinjump through the Zebitite.

                    The mochtroid clip is usually for categories which do not collect speedboster before going through meridia.
                    The trick is used to get through the room before Botwoon, by clipping through a ceiling.
                    To do just that, go up above where the speedboster blocks are, and go down into the mochtroids "cage".
                    From here lead it into the corner next to the speedboster blocks, crouch, aim up with both diagonal-aim buttons,
                    freeze the mocktroid, then jump and aim down at the same time.
                    If you manage to get crouched, simply stand up.
                    This should get you through the ceiling.

            <p>
                The Red tower climb is a staple of super metroid speedruns, 
                and involves getting from the bottom of the "Red tower" in eastern brinstar, to the top.
                This is achieved by either using Ice beam, or Hi-jump boots.
                Using Ice beam to freeze the rippers is the intended way, and thus will not be covered further.
                Using Hi-jump however is harder. Starting from the bottom, 
                you need to get Samus to the one tile wide edge on the right side of the red tower,
                from there, a running jump gets you into the gap of the first climb, a walljump will get you to "safety".
                To get to the top you need to get past the Rippers and shoot open the blocks at the top.
                To do this there's two main ways.
                Either climb up, shoot open the blocks, then climb up again.
                Or you could fire a precise shot and climb with it to open the blocks and get through in one climb.
                To fire the shot, 
                try to land as close as possible to the right side of the topmost platform, beneath the rippers.
                Make sure you don't go too far upwards.
                Then charge a full charge-shot, make a small jump and uppon landing shoot.
                Then quickly jump upwards to make the shot connect.
                This trick works with chargebeam by itself, and other beam combos that leave the hitbox as it is.
                Keep in mind that Rippers die to one super missile.

                    To skip the moat without the grappling beam, 
                    runs that collect speedbooster can use a arial shinespark to cross the moat.
                    To do this, blow open the door, kill the two xihunters, and charge a shinespark,
                    either with a short-charge or regular. Then use an arial shinespark to cross the moat.
                    You might change the height of the spark to collect the missile pack, or not, depending on situation.

                    The continuous wall jump is a trick that is mainly performed in 
                    categories which kill phantoon before getting speedboster or grappling beam.
                    The trick is used to get over the moat before the entrance to wrecked ship.
                    To perform CWJ run up to the door next to the moat, then open the door, and run through the door.
                    Then time a 2-frame window to get max height and jump over the middle pillar. 
                    Either collect the missile pack during the CWJ, which is faster but harder, and time the next walljump, 
                    or collect the missile pack before the CWJ, and then time the walljump easier.
                
                    Here is the easier version, where you collect the missile pack beforehand:

                <p>
                The Silver Pirate quick kill is a trick to kill the silver pirates outside of Ridley's lair.
                The method is mainly used in categories where speed is necessary, 
                and where plasma beam hasn't been collected, allthough it is still possible with plasma beam.
                To perform the quick kill, charge a speedboster by running through the silver pirates.
                Avoid taking damage by shooting them as you reach them. 
                Once the speedboster state has been reached, spark diagonally upwards.
                Make sure you reach past the point to where the Silver Pirates start their attack.
                Once that is done the shine spark "echo" will take care of them.
                The second silver pirate can be dealt with by short-charging, 
                or by running back and speedbosting regularly.
                Then follow the same steps as for killing the first pirate.
